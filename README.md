- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheElcurtiso. I can do full-stack development things.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things. I have been programming Python and C# for the longest. I have made a website which was of course was programmed in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python for the backend but I have been told by many to just use NodeJS next time so maybe I will. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently am taking up many other swords namely Java and C++. I dip my toes into something like HTML every once and a while but I much prefer backend things.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: curtismay2404@gmail.com - thats my email but there's no way you are looking at something on Github and not knowing what an email is.
